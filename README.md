# Buy-Sell-Supermarket-Database
Java–SQL integrated supermarket management system.  
All changes are synchronized between the Java application and the PostgreSQL database in real time.


# Supermarket Management System – Java & SQL Integration

This academic project was developed as part of the Database Systems course at Afeka College.  
It extends a previous Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) supermarket management system by creating a full integration with a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.

All data and operations are synchronized between the Java application and the database:  
any change made in the pgAdmin interface is reflected in the Java program, and vice versa.  
The system supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and ensures data consistency across both environments.

## Technologies
- Java (JDBC)
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (DDL & DML)
- ERD Design (pgAdmin / Draw.io)
